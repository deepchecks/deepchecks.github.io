Test Your Deepchecks Vision Data Class
================================================

:doc:`Data Classes </user-guide/vision/data-classes/index>` are used to transform the structure of your data to the
structure required for deepchecks. To help ensure they work
as intended, deepchecks has built-in helper functions for
validating their structure. This guide will demonstrate how to use this helper function
to implement them for your own data, step by step.


**Structure:**

* `Load data and model <#load-data-and-model>`__
* `Create simple DetectionData object <#create-simple-detectiondata-object>`__
* `Running the extractors validation <#running-the-extractors-validation>`__
* `Understand validation results <#understand-validation-results>`__
* `The end result <#the-end-result>`__

Load data and model
-------------------
In the first step we load the DataLoader and our model

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-31

.. code-block:: default


    from deepchecks.vision.datasets.detection.coco import load_dataset, load_model

    data_loader = load_dataset(train=False, batch_size=1000, object_type='DataLoader')
    model = load_model()

Create simple DetectionData object
----------------------------------
In the second step since this is an object detection task we will override a
DetectionData object with simple extracting functions. We know our DataLoader
and model's output are not in the format expected by deepchecks, so when we
validate them on our data we will see in the results the functions we overrided
are not passing, and then we will implement a correct functions.

    import torch


    class CocoDetectionData(DetectionData):
        def batch_to_images(self, batch):
            return batch[0]

        def batch_to_labels(self, batch):
            return [torch.round(x) for x in batch[1]]

            return model.to(device)(batch[0])









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-62

Running the extractors validation
---------------------------------
Now we will load our validate function and see the results while running
the extractors on our data. The function will print for us the validation
results. At the end, if all your extractors are valid the output should look
in `this <#The-end-result>`__.

    Deepchecks will try to validate the extractors given...
    Structure validation
    --------------------
    Label formatter: Pass!
    Prediction formatter: Check requires detection predictions to be a sequence with an entry for each sample
    Image formatter: Fail! The data inside the iterable must be a numpy array.

    Content validation
    ------------------
    For validating the content within the structure you have to manually observe the classes, image, label and prediction.
    Examples of classes observed in the batch's labels: [[597, 253, 107, 26, 76, 247, 193, 149, 0, 545, 223, 218, 20, 174, 19, 512], [431, 181, 112, 215, 219, 563, 209, 546, 35, 224], [76, 73], [180, 2], [60, 0]]
    Visual images & label & prediction: Unable to show due to invalid image formatter.

    False



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-84

Understand validation results
-----------------------------
When looking at the result we can see is that it is separated into 2 parts.

First part is about the structure we expect to get. This validation is automatic
since it's purely technical and doesn't check content correctness. For example,
in our validation above we see that the label extractor is passing, meaning the
labels are provided in the expected format.

Second part is about the content, which cannot be automatically validated and requires your attention. This part
includes looking visually at data outputted by the formatters to validate it is
correct. In the validation above we see a list of classes that doesn't seem to make much
sense - it contains class_ids in values ranging from 0 to 596 while in the COCO dataset there are only 80 classes.

For the next step we'll fix the label extractor and then validate again:

            # to be at the first position.

them to be, values between 0 and 79. Now we can continue and fix the prediction extractor

Now our prediction formatter also have valid structure. But in order to really
validate it we also need visual assertion and for that we need the image extractor to work.

Now that that image extractor is valid it displays for us visually the label and prediction.
When we look at the label we see it is correct, but when we look at the bounding box predictions something
seems broken.

We need to fix the prediction so the prediction will be returned in [x, y, w, h, confidence, class] format.
