        "Simple Feature Contribution\n===========================\n\nThis notebook provides an overview for using and understanding the\n\\\"Simple Feature Contribution Train Test\\\" check.\n\n**Structure:**\n\n-   [What is the purpose of the\n    check?](#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-check)\n-   [Run check on a classification\n    task](#run-the-check-on-a-classification-task-mnist)\n-   [Run check on an Object Detection\n    task](#run-the-check-on-an-object-detection-task-coco)\n-   [Define a condition](#define-a-condition)\n\nWhat is the purpose of the check?\n---------------------------------\n\nThe check estimates for every image property (such as brightness,\ncontrast etc.) its ability to predict the label by itself. This check\ncan help find:\n\n-   A potential bias in one or both datasets, that leads to the the\n    labels being strongly correlated with simple image properties such\n    as color, brightness, aspect ratio and more. This is a critical\n    problem, that will likely stay hidden without this check (as it\n    won\\'t pop up when comparing model performance on train and test).\n\nThe check is based on calculating the predictive power score (PPS) of\neach image property. For more details you can read here [how the PPS is\ncalculated](#how-is-the-predictive-power-score-pps-calculated).\n\n### What is a problematic result?\n\n1.  Image properties with a high predictive score - can indicate that\n    there is a bias in the dataset, as a single property can predict the\n    label successfully, using simple classic ML algorithms.\n\n    This means that a deep learning algorithm may accidentally learn\n    these properties instead of more accurate complex abstractions. For\n    example, in a classification dataset of wolves and dogs photographs,\n    if only wolves are photographed in the snow, the brightness of the\n    image may be used to predict the label \\\"wolf\\\" easily.\n\n    In this case, a model might not learn to discern wolf from dog by\n    the animal\\'s characteristics, but by using the background color.\n\n2.  A high difference between the PPS scores of a certain image property\n    in the train and in the test datasets - this is an indication for a\n    drift between the relation of the property and the label and a\n    possible bias in one of the datasets.\n\n    For example: an object detection dataset that identifies household\n    items. In it, a pen would usually create a long and thin rectangle\n    bounding box. If in the test dataset the pens would be angled\n    differently, or other object are mistakenly identified as pens, the\n    bounding boxes may have a different aspect ratio. In this case, the\n    PPS of the train dataset will be high, while the PPS of the test\n    dataset would be low, indicating that a bias in the train dataset\n    does not appear in the test dataset, and could indicate the model\n    will not be able to infer correctly on the test (or any other)\n    dataset due to drift.\n\n### How do we calculate for different vision tasks?\n\n-   For classification tasks, this check uses PPS to predict the class\n    by image properties.\n-   For object detection tasks, this check uses PPS to predict the class\n    of each bounding box, by the image properties of that specific\n    bounding box. This means that for each image, this check crops all\n    the sub-images defined by bounding boxes, and uses them as inputs as\n    though they were regular classification dataset images.\n\n### How is the Predictive Power Score (PPS) calculated?\n\nThe properties\\' predictive score results in a numeric score between 0\n(feature has no predictive power) and 1 (feature can fully predict the\nlabel alone).\n\nThe process of calculating the PPS is the following:\n\nThe properties\\' predictive score results in a numeric score between 0\n(feature has no predictive power) and 1 (feature can fully predict the\nlabel alone).\n\nThe process of calculating the PPS is the following:\n\n1.  Extract from the data only the label and the feature being tested\n2.  Drop samples with missing values\n3.  Keep 5000 (this is configurable parameter) samples from the data\n4.  Preprocess categorical columns. For the label using\n    [sklearn.LabelEncoder]{.title-ref} and for the feature using\n    [sklearn.OneHotEncoder]{.title-ref}\n5.  Partition the data with 4-fold cross-validation\n6.  Train decision tree\n7.  Compare the trained model\\'s performance with naive model\\'s\n    performance as follows:\n\n    Regression: The naive model always predicts the median of the label\n    column, the metric being used is MAE and the PPS calculation is:\n    $1 - \frac{        ext{MAE model}}\n    {    ext{MAE naive}}$\n\n    Classification: The naive model always predicts the most common\n    class of the label column, The metric being used is F1 and the PPS\n    calculation is:\n    $\frac{ ext{F1 model} -         ext{F1 naive}}{1 -      ext{F1 naive}}$\n\n*Note: all the PPS parameters can be changed by passing to the check the\nparameter \\`\\`ppscore\\_params\\`\\`*\n\nFor further information about PPS you can visit the [ppscore\ngithub](https://github.com/8080labs/ppscore) or the following blog post:\n[RIP correlation.
