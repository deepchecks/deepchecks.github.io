## Documentation Structure

This repository contains two sets of documentation:

1. Main Deepchecks Documentation
   - Located in the root directory
   - Versioned (e.g., 0.10, 0.11, ..., 0.18)
   - Latest stable version symlinked as "stable"

2. LLM Evaluation Documentation
   - Located in the "llmdocs" directory
   - Versioned (e.g., 0.11, 0.12, ..., 0.15)
   - Latest stable version symlinked as "stable"

Both documentation sets use a version switcher (switcher.json) to manage different versions.

## URLs

- Main Documentation: https://docs.deepchecks.com/
- LLM Documentation: https://docs.deepchecks.com/llmdocs/

For specific versions, append the version number to the URL, e.g.:
- https://docs.deepchecks.com/0.18/
- https://docs.deepchecks.com/llmdocs/0.15/

The "stable" symlink always points to the latest stable version for both documentation sets.
