        "\n\n# Predicting Loan Defaults (Classification)\n\nIn this Demo we are using an adaptation of the [Lending Club loan data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)_ dataset to show how you can use Deepchecks to\nmonitor and identify issues in a Loan Default prediction task.\n\nYou are a Data Scientist in a renowned bank, and you are tasked with identifying customers that are\nlikely to default on their mortgage loan. In this example we'll use Deepchecks to quickly detect some data integrity\nissues that occur over the lifetime of the model, and we'll see how Deepchecks can alert us about potential model\ndeterioration that can be caused by increasing interest rates, even while labels are not yet available.\n\n1. `Setting You Up on Deepchecks`_\n2. `Creating a Model & Model Version`_\n3. `Uploading Production Data`_\n4. `Analyzing Using Deepchecks`_\n\n..  tip::\n    To see how Deepchecks Monitoring is used, you can skip right to `Analyzing Using Deepchecks`_\n\n## Setting You Up on Deepchecks\n\n### Installation & API key\n\nIn order to work with Deepchecks Monitoring, you need to:\n\n1. Install with ``pip`` the deepchecks-client SDK\n2. Log in to the Deepchecks Monitoring app and create an organization\n3. Obtain an API key from the app\n\nFor more details, please refer to the :doc:`Quickstart </user-guide/tabular/auto_quickstarts/plot_quickstart>`.\n\n### Creating a Client\n\nTo work with Deepchecks Monitoring we first instantiate a client object.\n"

        "### Making Sure Your Data Has Arrived\n\nIf you're not sure if your data has arrived, please refer to the relevant section in the\n`Production Data guide <tabular_production__validating_your_data_has_arrived>`.\n\n## Analyzing Using Deepchecks\n\nNow that you have our data in Deepchecks, you can start analyzing it. Has the model been performing well? The\neconomy has been entering a mild recession recently and you managers have raised concerns that this may have\naffected your model's ability to correctly predict loan defaults. You set to investigate.\n\n### Dashboard & Alerts - Finding Drift\n\nWhen you log in to Deepchecks, you'll be greeted by the Dashboard, in which you can view all the monitors defined for\nyour models. Selecting our ``Loan Default - Example`` model, we see the default monitors and their corresponding\ndefault alert rules. We can also see that the Aggregate Feature Drift monitor has exceeded the default alert rule\nthreshold, and has triggered an alert. We can click on the alert to see more details.\n\n<img src=\"file://_static/images/examples/lending/dashboard.gif\" alt=\"Dashboard\" align=\"center\">\n\nOnce in the alert screen, you can see the list of all current alerts on your model. Clicking on that alert will\nopen an alert analysis screen. This screen has three main components - the monitor history graph, the segment explorer\nand the check details.\n\n1. The monitor history graph shows the monitor's value over time and the point at which the alert was triggered.\n2. The segment explorer allows you to see what was the value of the check at the time of the alert, in different\n   segments of the data.\n3. The check details section shows the details of the check that triggered the alert.\n\nIn this case, you can see in the check details section that there is significant drift in the ``int_rate`` feature,\nwhose average has increased dramatically. This is the case for the \"All Data\" segment, but does this issue originate\nfrom a specific segment? Let's find out.\n\n<img src=\"file://_static/images/examples/lending/alert.gif\" alt=\"Alert\" align=\"center\">\n\nSegmenting on the ``term`` feature, we can easily see that the drift is coming mostly from long term loans. This is\nnot surprising, as the economy has been entering a mild recession recently, and long term loans are more sensitive to\nincreases in interest rates.\n\n### Analysis - Detecting Integrity Issues\n\nOnce you got this major drift issue under control, you may be interested in looking for other issues in your data.\nFor freely exploring the status, you can head to the Analysis screen. There you can run any of the checks\nyou defined for your model over different time periods and segments and easily change the parameters of the checks.\n\nScrolling down the list of checks, you'll find that the ``Percent of Nulls`` check had some non-zero values in the\npast few months.\n\n<img src=\"file://_static/images/examples/lending/analysis.gif\" alt=\"Analysis\" align=\"center\">\n\nClicking the check at one of the times it had been non-zero, we can see that we have some nulls in the\n``home_ownership`` feature. Furthermore, using the \"Check Per Segment\" part of the screen we can see the value of the\ncheck when the data is segmented by various features. In this case, we can see that the nulls are happening\nexclusively in loans made in California. Time to talk to the Data Engineering team! Seems like there has been some\nissue with the data pipeline coming from the state of California.\n\n## Updating Labels\n\nIn many use-cases, such as with Loan status, the labels may arrive way after the model prediction was made. In\nthese cases it is possible to update the labels of samples that where previously unlabeled. Let's say for example\nthat we have just learned of a few loans that where paid in full, then we can update their labels using the\nfollowing function:\n\n\n"
