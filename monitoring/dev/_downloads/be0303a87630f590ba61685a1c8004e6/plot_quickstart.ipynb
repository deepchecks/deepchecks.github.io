        "\n\n# Quickstart - Get Deepchecks Monitoring Up and Running\n\nThis is a good starting point for monitoring your tabular model using Deepchecks Monitoring. We'll\nquickly walk you through setting up a model to represent your task in the system, uploading data, setting the\ncomputed checks and alerts in the system and seeing some results for your effort. We'll be using the\n[Airbnb rent regression dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)_, in which\nthe rent of the Airbnb unit is predicted from a set of features describing the rental unit.\n\n```bash\n# Before we start, if you don't have deepchecks-client installed yet, run:\nimport sys\n!{sys.executable} -m pip install -U deepchecks-client\n\n# or install using pip from your python environment\n```\n## Creating a New Model Version\n\nOur first step is to create a new model version in the system. In Deepchecks, a model represents an ML pipeline\nperforming a single task in production, e.g. new multiple retrained version. The model groups together all the model\nversions that are performing the same task, where the model's versions and the structure of the data may change over\ntime.\nOur terminology to refer to a specific version within a model is \"model version\".\n\nIn order to create a version we must specify the feature schema of the version, including the names and\ntypes of the features. It is also highly recommended to provide the feature importance of these features,\nwhich is used by the system to prioritize features in various calculations and displays.\n\nThe easiest way to create a model version, which is demonstrated\nhere, requires a `Dataset <deepchecks:tabular__dataset_object>` object\ncontaining the reference data for the version. Reference data is a dataset to which we wish to compare\nour production data stream. Typically, this will be the dataset on which the model was trained.\nProviding reference data is optional yet many important `checks <deepchecks:general__deepchecks_hierarchyy>`\nsuch as `Feature Drift (Tabular Version) <deepchecks:tabular__feature_drift>`\ncannot run without it.\n"
