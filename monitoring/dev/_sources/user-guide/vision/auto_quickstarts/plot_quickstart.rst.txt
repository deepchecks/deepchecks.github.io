Quickstart - Get Deepchecks Monitoring Up and Running for Computer Vision Data
******************************************************************************

This quickstart is the perfect starting point for monitoring your vision model using Deepchecks Monitoring. We'll
quickly walk you through setting up a model to represent your task in the system, uploading data, setting the
computed checks and alerts in the system and seeing some results for your effort. We'll be using the
`Mask Detection Dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection>`__, in which
the goal of the model is to detect faces, and classify whether the face is wearing a mask, partially wearing a mask or not wearing a mask.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Before we start, if you don't have deepchecks-client installed yet, run:
    import sys
    !{sys.executable} -m pip install -U deepchecks-client

    # or install using pip from your python environment

Creating a New Model Version
============================

Our first step is to create a new model version in the system. A model in Deepchecks Monitoring
represents an ML pipeline performing a single task in production through time,
where the model's versions and the structure of the data may change over time.
Our terminology to refer to a specific version within a model is "model version".

The easiest way to create a model version, which is demonstrated
here, requires a :doc:`Vision Data <deepchecks:user-guide/vision/data-classes>` object
containing the reference data for the version. Reference data is a dataset to which we wish to compare
our production data stream. Typically, this will be the dataset on which the model was trained.
Providing reference data is optional yet many important :doc:`checks <deepchecks:user-guide/general/deepchecks_hierarchy>`
such as :doc:`Train Test Prediction Drift (Vision Version) <deepchecks:checks_gallery/vision/model_evaluation/plot_train_test_prediction_drift>`
cannot run without it.

Preparing the Reference Data
-------------------------------

In this example we're loading a pre-made VisionData object containing the data at the first time stamp, with which
the model was trained. In order to create your own VisionData object from your own pytorch dataloader
please read the :doc:`Vision Data <deepchecks:user-guide/vision/data-classes/index>` documentation or follow the
appropriate deepchecks computer vision :doc:`quickstart <deepchecks:user-guide/vision/auto_quickstarts/index>`.

2. A dictionary where the values are the predictions and the keys are the image indices in the pytorch Dataset object.

Creating a model version
------------------------
In order to create a model version we must first create an organization in the
`deepchecks system <https://app.deepchecks.com/>`_ and generate a personal
API token using the application's dashboard.

.. image:: /_static/images/quickstart/get_api_token.png
   :width: 600

Using the API token we can now create a new model version and upload the reference data.

Uploading Production Data
=========================

No matter what else you'll be doing with Deepchecks Monitoring, it will start by uploading some production data that
you want monitored. In this the mask data collected for dates ranging from the start of July 2022 to the end of
August 2022. For simplicity and quicker runtime, we'll upload only the last few days in this tutorial.
Then, we'll update the labels for some of the samples we uploaded.

Uploading Data and Predictions

Images, labels and prediction must be provided in specific required formats.
The required format for the can be found at :doc:`here <deepchecks:user-guide/vision/data-classes/index>`.
Please look at the following entries:

- Image format - can be found at :doc:`here <deepchecks:user-guide/vision/data-classes/VisionData>`.
- Label & prediction format - look at documentation of the respective VisionData subclass according to your task type

In this example, the changes needed in the data format are pretty trivial, but in more complex cases
you may either implement them in dedicated functions (such as the ``extract_label_dict`` function here), or use
the ``batch_to_image`` and other formatting methods you already implemented as part of building your
Deepchecks VisionData object.

Updating the Labels
-------------------
In many real world scenarios, the labels of the data are only available at a later time. We can update them
in hindsight using the global sample ids. Here we update the last sample that was uploaded.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 159-164

.. code-block:: default


    model_version.update_sample(sample_id=indices[-1],
                                label=[extract_label_dict(tensor) for tensor in batch[1]][-1])
    model_version.send()

You can update multiple samples. Once done updating all desired samples, call the `send` method to upload the samples
and make the updates appear in the system.

When updating multiple samples we can verify that status of the process that is running in the background by checking
the amount of samples that have been processed and uploaded by the system, using:
model_version.time_window_statistics(min(prod_data[timestamp]), max(prod_data[timestamp]))
upon completion, the statistics should equal the total number of samples sent

The Dashboard Screen
====================
After creating the model version and uploading the data, we can now see the monitors within the
`application dashboard <https://app.deepchecks.com/>`_.
The monitors below are generated by default when a new model is created, all versions of the same model are tracked
within the same monitor.

Note: The displayed dashboard was created using all the production data, not only the last few days

If we wish to remove the model to free up space for new models we can do it in the following way:
