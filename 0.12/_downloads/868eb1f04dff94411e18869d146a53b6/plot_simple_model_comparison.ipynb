        "Simple Model Comparison {#plot_tabular_simple_model_comparison}\n=======================\n\nThis notebook provides an overview for using and understanding simple\nmodel comparison check.\n\n**Structure:**\n\n-   [What is the purpose of the\n    check?](#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-check)\n-   [Generate data & model](#generate-data-model)\n-   [Run the check](#run-the-check)\n-   [Define a condition](#define-a-condition)\n\nWhat is the purpose of the check?\n---------------------------------\n\nThe simple model is designed to produce the best performance achievable\nusing very simple rules. The goal of the simple model is to provide a\nbaseline of minimal model performance for the given task, to which the\nuser model may be compared. If the user model achieves less or a similar\nscore to the simple model, this is an indicator for a possible problem\nwith the model (e.g. it wasn\\'t trained properly).\n\nThe check has three possible \\\"simple model\\\" heuristics, from which one\nis chosen and compared to. By default the check uses the\n**most\\_frequent** heuristic, which can be overridden in the checks\\'\nparameters using strategy. There is no simple model which is more\n\\\"correct\\\" to use, each gives a different baseline to compare to, and\nyou may experiment with the different types and see how it performs on\nyour data.\n\nThe simple models are:\n\n-   A **most\\_frequent** model - The default. In regression the\n    prediction is equal to the mean value, in classification the\n    prediction is equal to the most common value.\n-   A **uniform** model - In regression, selects a random value from the\n    y range. In classification, selects one of the labels by random.\n-   A **stratified** model - Draws the prediction from the distribution\n    of the labels in the train.\n-   A **tree** model - Trains a simple decision tree with a given depth.\n    The depth can be customized using the `max_depth` parameter.\n"

Its purpose is to reflect the\nsignificance of the said improvement. Take for example for a metric\nbetween 0 and 1. A change of only 0.03 that takes us from 0.95 to 0.98\nis highly significant (especially in an imbalance scenario), but\nimproving from 0.1 to 0.13 is not a great achievement.\n\nThe gain is calculated as:\n$gain = \\frac{\\text{model score} - \\text{simple score}}\n{\\text{perfect score} - \\text{simple score}}$\n\nLet\\'s add a condition to the check and see what happens when it fails:\n"
